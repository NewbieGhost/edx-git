 This is a new approach to git hub through the edx course

So I've made a new repo over github
cloned it to my pc using
git clone file address

After I've edited the code use
git add file name

So after adding a file and editing it use
git commit -m "message"

We can use git status to see the current status

After commiting a file, to save changes to git hub use
git push

We can also download the changes that are made to the
file over the remote repo, to do this use 
git pull

Conflicts
If I've made a change to the same line
of a file

Say this line, which I've edited over the hub and also edited locally
and haven't pushed the changes

so when we will pull this kind of file we will see 
a message stating there is a conflict
We can edit the conflict by opening the file locally 
and deleting the unwanted lines

After that we can add and commit the files
and can push it
