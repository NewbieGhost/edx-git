 This is a new approach to git hub through the edx course

So I've made a new repo over github
cloned it to my pc using
git clone file address

After I've edited the code use
git add file name

So after adding a file and editing it use
git commit -m "message"

We can use git status to see the current status

After commiting a file, to save changes to git hub use
git push

We can also download the changes that are made to the
file over the remote repo, to do this use 
git pull

Conflicts
If I've made a change to the same line
of a file

Say this line, which I've edited over the hub and also edited locally
